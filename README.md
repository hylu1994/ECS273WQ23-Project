# ECS273 final project
- We precompute the value needed for this dataset in server/data/kernel_prob.json and server/data/orig_graphs.json
- We have three .vue files in the dashboard/src/components for the three columns.
- Install grakel package: pip3 install grakel (Though it is only used for precomputation, it is still in the import list just in case we need to compute the values again.)
- Run the system (under dashboard/): npm run start
